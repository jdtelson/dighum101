Supernovae,Stanford E. Woosley,"Supernova explosions are not only important to the ecology of the universe, seeding it, among other things, with the heavy elements necessary for the existence of life, but they are also a natural laboratory in which a host of unique physical phenomena occur. While still far from a complete understanding, scientists have made great advances during the last twenty-five years in understanding the nature and conse- quences of supernovae. This book presents the state of supernova studies at the beginning of the 1990's, as reported at a two-week meeting on the Santa Cruz campus of the University of California in July 1989 in- volving 177 astronomers and astrophysicists from 17 nations. The 110 papers contained in this volume report all aspects of the field - observations at all wavelengths from radio through gamma-rays, bolometric light curves and spectra, neutrino observations, the theory of stellar explosions, multidimensional models for mixing, nucleosynthesis calculations, synthetic spectral modeling, presupernova evolution, supernova remnants, supernova rates, supernovae as standard candles, the interaction of supernovae with their surroundings - and constitute the most comprehensive and up-to-date treatment of SN 1987A currently available. Astronomers and astronomy graduate students will find this an in valuable summary of the current state of supernova research.

Organizations and Strategies in Astronomy 6,Andre Heck,"When I wasa child, growing up in South America,I often went camping in the wild and hence had direct access to the wondrous Southern sky; the Southern Cross was all mine at the time. Little did I know then that the study of the sky would take such a huge importance in my life, and that in the end astronomy and astrophysics would in many ways become my country and my religion. I have lived in several di?erent countries, and when asked my nationality, I am always very tempted to reply: astronomer. I started as a theorist, and my only dream in my youth was to spend nights thinking and calculating, with paper and pencil, and to have the impression by dawn that I had understood something new. So at the time astronomy was seen or dreamt by me as a solitary endeavour, with periodic encounters with my wise adviser and professors; it is this model that I adopted when doing my PhD work. My generation has lived through many revolutions of all kinds. Those in astronomy, I believe, remain particularly remarkable, and I am a true product of them. Now, I elect to live and work in large organizations, and to share my endeavours with many people.

American Astronomy,"John Lankford,Ricky L.

He tallies the number with and without doctorates, the number that taught in colleges or universities versus those involved in industrial or government work, the number of women versus men, and so on. He also addresses the crucial question of power within the community—what it meant, which astronomers had it, and what they did with it. Drawing on more than a decade of archival research, Lankford attends to the numbers in concise tables and figures, and takes care to focus through biographical sketches on the human beings his data represent. This dual approach convincingly illustrates how the changing structure of a scientific community can alter both the career trajectories of its members and the nature of the scientific research they choose to pursue.",University of Chicago Press

American Astronomy,"John Lankford,Ricky L.

He tallies the number with and without doctorates, the number that taught in colleges or universities versus those involved in industrial or government work, the number of women versus men, and so on. He also addresses the crucial question of power within the community—what it meant, which astronomers had it, and what they did with it. Drawing on more than a decade of archival research, Lankford attends to the numbers in concise tables and figures, and takes care to focus through biographical sketches on the human beings his data represent. This dual approach convincingly illustrates how the changing structure of a scientific community can alter both the career trajectories of its members and the nature of the scientific research they choose to pursue.",University of Chicago Press

Supernovae,Stanford E. Woosley,"Supernova explosions are not only important to the ecology of the universe, seeding it, among other things, with the heavy elements necessary for the existence of life, but they are also a natural laboratory in which a host of unique physical phenomena occur. While still far from a complete understanding, scientists have made great advances during the last twenty-five years in understanding the nature and conse- quences of supernovae. This book presents the state of supernova studies at the beginning of the 1990's, as reported at a two-week meeting on the Santa Cruz campus of the University of California in July 1989 in- volving 177 astronomers and astrophysicists from 17 nations. The 110 papers contained in this volume report all aspects of the field - observations at all wavelengths from radio through gamma-rays, bolometric light curves and spectra, neutrino observations, the theory of stellar explosions, multidimensional models for mixing, nucleosynthesis calculations, synthetic spectral modeling, presupernova evolution, supernova remnants, supernova rates, supernovae as standard candles, the interaction of supernovae with their surroundings - and constitute the most comprehensive and up-to-date treatment of SN 1987A currently available. Astronomers and astronomy graduate students will find this an in valuable summary of the current state of supernova research. The informed layperson or undergraduate astronomy student will also find it a useful introduction and guide to the literature in the subject.",Springer Science & Business Media

Organizations and Strategies in Astronomy 6,Andre Heck,"When I wasa child, growing up in South America,I often went camping in the wild and hence had direct access to the wondrous Southern sky; the Southern Cross was all mine at the time. Little did I know then that the study of the sky would take such a huge importance in my life, and that in the end astronomy and astrophysics would in many ways become my country and my religion. I have lived in several di?erent countries, and when asked my nationality, I am always very tempted to reply: astronomer. I started as a theorist, and my only dream in my youth was to spend nights thinking and calculating, with paper and pencil, and to have the impression by dawn that I had understood something new. So at the time astronomy was seen or dreamt by me as a solitary endeavour, with periodic encounters with my wise adviser and professors; it is this model that I adopted when doing my PhD work. My generation has lived through many revolutions of all kinds. Those in astronomy, I believe, remain particularly remarkable, and I am a true product of them. Now, I elect to live and work in large organizations, and to share my endeavours with many people.
