Sasquatches from Outer Space,Tim Yule,"Amazing things seem to be happening all the time. Supermarket tabloids say aliens are kidnaping people. TV programs report that apelike creatures prowl the Himalayas leaving giant footprints behind, planes and ships mysteriously vanish in the Bermuda Triangle, and flattened circles in open fields prove that UFOs have landed.It may be fun to watch or read about these weird stories and extraordinary claims, but whether you really believe them or not can make a big difference in your life. For one thing you can spend a lot of money on books, videos, movies, and services like psychic hotlines marketed by people who are interested only in taking your money. But more important than money is how you view reality and judge the difference between fact and fiction. How can you figure out who's telling the truth and who isn't?It's not that hard, says educator Tim Yule, once you've learned a few basic critical-thinking skills. He explores many of the strange and funny mysteries that capture so much media attention and teaches you, through hands-on experiments, how to get to the bottom of these tall tales. You'll have fun while learning how scientists establish reliable knowledge.If you want to know the truth about astrology, UFOs, Big Foot, and the Loch Ness Monster, the Bermuda Triangle, crop circles, vampires, ESP, predicting the future, and more, this book is better than any ouija board or fortuneteller.Tim Yule (Prince George, British Columbia, Canada) has been teaching elementary school for eleven years and has worked with children for over twenty years.",Prometheus Books

An Earthling's Guide to Outer Space,Bob McDonald,"Beloved science commentator Bob McDonald takes us on a tour of our galaxy, unraveling the mysteries of the universe and helping us navigate our place among the stars. How big is our galaxy? Is there life on those distant planets? Are we really made of star dust? And where do stars even come from? In An Earthling’s Guide to Outer Space, we finally have the answers to all those questions and more. With clarity, wisdom, and a great deal of enthusiasm, McDonald explores the curiosities of the big blue planet we call home as well as our galactic neighbours—from Martian caves to storm clouds on Jupiter to the nebulae at the far end of the universe. So if you’re pondering how to become an astronaut, or what dark matter really is, or how an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, look no further. Through a captivating mix of stories, experiments, and illustrations, McDonald walks us through space exploration past and present, and reveals what we can look forward to in the future. An Earthling’s Guide to Outer Space is sure to satisfy science readers of all ages, and to remind us earthbound terrestrials just how special our place in the universe truly is.",Simon and Schuster

International Law and Outer Space Activities,Ogunsola O. Ogunbanwo,"Space exploration is a development which began with the launching of the first artificial satellite in 1957. Since then an incredible progress has been made, leading to the landing of man on the moon. A quick look at the number of launchings which have been registered with the United Nations will show the influence of space science and technology on human endeavours. For example, satellites can be used for com munication, weather forecasting, education, and remote sensing of the resources of the Earth. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is the focal point of international co-operation in space activities. The Committee regulates these activities through its Legal Sub-Committee. The setting up of the Committee was preceded by an Ad Hoc Committee which was established on 31 December 1958. The initial difficulty which confronted the Ad Hoc Committee was the issue of its member ship. The USSR, Czechoslovakia and Poland decided not to participate in its work because they were dissatisfied with the composition of the Ad Hoc Committee. Later, both the UAR and India also decided not to participate in its work. Although the Ad Hoc Committee succeeded in producing a report in 1959 (UN document A/4141), the progress of work of the Main Committee was in limbo for a while. It was not until 1961 that the disagreements were resolved. The Committee conducts its business without voting -the Chairman simply states the consensus of views which have been expressed.",BRILL

In these pages, we find such gems as Eisenhower's reactions to Sputnik, the original NASA astronaut application, John Glenn's reflections on zero gravity, Kennedy's directives to go to the moon, discussions on what Neil Armstrong's first famous first words should be, customs forms filled out by astronauts bringing back moon rocks, transcribed conversations with Nixon on ending Project Apollo and beginning the space shuttle program, and so much more.",Penguin
Commercial Utilization of Outer Space,Hanneke Louise Van Traa-Engelman,"This book assesses the present status of space activity regulation against the background of the progressive commercialization of outer space. The basic legal framework for outer space activity was established during a time when space endeavour was still in its infancy and a critical reassessment of its principles therefore forms the basis of this publication.

The Law and Policy of Air Space and Outer Space,Peter P. C. Haanappel,"This is a policy oriented and comparatively oriented textbook on air and space law for students and practitioners. It covers the history and development in air and space law; their interrelationships with the law of the seas and the law of Antartica; institutions working in the field of air and space law; sovereignty in national penal air law; private international air law, especially liability law; and public and private space law Much attention is devoted to the law of air commerce: bilateral air services agreements; inter-airline co-operation; the effect of competition, antitrust and European Union law; deregulation, privatization and commercialization of air transport; ownership and control of airlines, and airline alliances; multilateralisation of air transport; and congestion and environmental controls. The last chapter of the book briefly deals with the legal aspects of commercial outer space application.

Sovereignty and Jurisdiction in Airspace and Outer Space,Gbenga Oduntan,"Sovereignty and jurisdiction are legal doctrines of a complex nature, which have been subject to differing interpretations by scholars in legal literature. The tridimensionality of state territory recognised under customary international law subsists until the present but there are other territories that do not or cannot belong to any state or political entity which also must be accounted for in legal theory. The issues surrounding sovereignty and jurisdiction are likely to become ever more pressing as globalisation, growing pressure on resources and the need for energy and national security become acute, and the resolution of special delimitation disputes seems likely to become a vital question in the twenty-first century. As a result of the fast pace of technological developments in air and space activities and the massive increases in air transportation , satellite communications and space exploration, the need for scholars and practitioners to sharpen their appreciation of the legal and political issues becomes crucial. This book will focus primarily on the issues of sovereignty jurisdiction and control in airspace and outer space and their effects on public and private activities, but it will also look at related issues pertaining to the Seas and Antarctica. Commercial exploitation, resource control and the international regime regulating contractual obligations in relation to transportation of goods and services over all forms of territory will be examined to the extent that they are necessary to explain jurisdictional rights and duties over territory. Older problems of international law such as crimes in the air and airspace trespass are treated along with newer developments such as space tourism as well as growing demand for private ownership and involvement in outer space exploitation. The book goes on to consider the distinction between airspace and outer space and puts forward legal criteria which would allow for the resolution of the spatial delimitation dispute. These criteria would determine where in spatial terms the exclusive sovereignty of airspace ends and where outer space – the province of all mankind – begins, and contribute to the jurisprudence of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction.",Routledge

Sovereignty and Jurisdiction in Airspace and Outer Space,Gbenga Oduntan,"Sovereignty and jurisdiction are legal doctrines of a complex nature, which have been subject to differing interpretations by scholars in legal literature. The tridimensionality of state territory recognised under customary international law subsists until the present but there are other territories that do not or cannot belong to any state or political entity which also must be accounted for in legal theory. The issues surrounding sovereignty and jurisdiction are likely to become ever more pressing as globalisation, growing pressure on resources and the need for energy and national security become acute, and the resolution of special delimitation disputes seems likely to become a vital question in the twenty-first century. As a result of the fast pace of technological developments in air and space activities and the massive increases in air transportation , satellite communications and space exploration, the need for scholars and practitioners to sharpen their appreciation of the legal and political issues becomes crucial. This book will focus primarily on the issues of sovereignty jurisdiction and control in airspace and outer space and their effects on public and private activities, but it will also look at related issues pertaining to the Seas and Antarctica. Commercial exploitation, resource control and the international regime regulating contractual obligations in relation to transportation of goods and services over all forms of territory will be examined to the extent that they are necessary to explain jurisdictional rights and duties over territory. Older problems of international law such as crimes in the air and airspace trespass are treated along with newer developments such as space tourism as well as growing demand for private ownership and involvement in outer space exploitation.

As a result of the fast pace of technological developments in air and space activities and the massive increases in air transportation , satellite communications and space exploration, the need for scholars and practitioners to sharpen their appreciation of the legal and political issues becomes crucial. This book will focus primarily on the issues of sovereignty jurisdiction and control in airspace and outer space and their effects on public and private activities, but it will also look at related issues pertaining to the Seas and Antarctica. Commercial exploitation, resource control and the international regime regulating contractual obligations in relation to transportation of goods and services over all forms of territory will be examined to the extent that they are necessary to explain jurisdictional rights and duties over territory. Older problems of international law such as crimes in the air and airspace trespass are treated along with newer developments such as space tourism as well as growing demand for private ownership and involvement in outer space exploitation. The book goes on to consider the distinction between airspace and outer space and puts forward legal criteria which would allow for the resolution of the spatial delimitation dispute. These criteria would determine where in spatial terms the exclusive sovereignty of airspace ends and where outer space – the province of all mankind – begins, and contribute to the jurisprudence of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction.",Routledge
Science Fiction Cinema,"Geoff King,Tanya Krzywinska","This book charts the dimensions of one of the most popular genres in the cinema. From lurid comic-book blockbusters to dark dystopian visions, science fiction is seen as both a powerful cultural barometer of our times and the product of particular industrial and commercial frameworks. The authors outline the major themes of the genre, from representations of the mad scientist and computer hacker to the relationship between science fiction and postmodernism, exploring issues such as the meaning of special effects and the influence of science fiction cinema on the entertainment media of the digital age. Over one hundred films are discussed and the book concludes with an extensive case study of Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace.",Wallflower Press
Sasquatches from Outer Space,Tim Yule,"Amazing things seem to be happening all the time. Supermarket tabloids say aliens are kidnaping people. TV programs report that apelike creatures prowl the Himalayas leaving giant footprints behind, planes and ships mysteriously vanish in the Bermuda Triangle, and flattened circles in open fields prove that UFOs have landed.It may be fun to watch or read about these weird stories and extraordinary claims, but whether you really believe them or not can make a big difference in your life. For one thing you can spend a lot of money on books, videos, movies, and services like psychic hotlines marketed by people who are interested only in taking your money. But more important than money is how you view reality and judge the difference between fact and fiction. How can you figure out who's telling the truth and who isn't?It's not that hard, says educator Tim Yule, once you've learned a few basic critical-thinking skills. He explores many of the strange and funny mysteries that capture so much media attention and teaches you, through hands-on experiments, how to get to the bottom of these tall tales. You'll have fun while learning how scientists establish reliable knowledge.If you want to know the truth about astrology, UFOs, Big Foot, and the Loch Ness Monster, the Bermuda Triangle, crop circles, vampires, ESP, predicting the future, and more, this book is better than any ouija board or fortuneteller.Tim Yule (Prince George, British Columbia, Canada) has been teaching elementary school for eleven years and has worked with children for over twenty years.",Prometheus Books

International Law and Outer Space Activities,Ogunsola O. Ogunbanwo,"Space exploration is a development which began with the launching of the first artificial satellite in 1957. Since then an incredible progress has been made, leading to the landing of man on the moon. A quick look at the number of launchings which have been registered with the United Nations will show the influence of space science and technology on human endeavours. For example, satellites can be used for com munication, weather forecasting, education, and remote sensing of the resources of the Earth. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is the focal point of international co-operation in space activities. The Committee regulates these activities through its Legal Sub-Committee. The setting up of the Committee was preceded by an Ad Hoc Committee which was established on 31 December 1958. The initial difficulty which confronted the Ad Hoc Committee was the issue of its member ship. The USSR, Czechoslovakia and Poland decided not to participate in its work because they were dissatisfied with the composition of the Ad Hoc Committee. Later, both the UAR and India also decided not to participate in its work. Although the Ad Hoc Committee succeeded in producing a report in 1959 (UN document A/4141), the progress of work of the Main Committee was in limbo for a while. It was not until 1961 that the disagreements were resolved. The Committee conducts its business without voting -the Chairman simply states the consensus of views which have been expressed.",BRILL

Commercial Utilization of Outer Space,Hanneke Louise Van Traa-Engelman,"This book assesses the present status of space activity regulation against the background of the progressive commercialization of outer space. The basic legal framework for outer space activity was established during a time when space endeavour was still in its infancy and a critical reassessment of its principles therefore forms the basis of this publication. The outcome of this analysis and the legal implications which result from applying it to practical space utilization yield an insight into the legal questions pertaining to space commercialization and its practical implementation. ""Commercial Utilization of Outer Space"" will be of great interest to academics and practitioners in the field of space activities, as well as to government policy makers in different sectors of space commercialization ranging from space transportation, satellite communication and remote sensing to space insurance and manufacturing in outer space. Wherever appropriate and feasible practical aspects have been dealt with against the background of present-day realities and developments foreseen for the future.",Martinus Nijhoff Publishers

The Law and Policy of Air Space and Outer Space,Peter P. C. Haanappel,"This is a policy oriented and comparatively oriented textbook on air and space law for students and practitioners. It covers the history and development in air and space law; their interrelationships with the law of the seas and the law of Antartica; institutions working in the field of air and space law; sovereignty in national penal air law; private international air law, especially liability law; and public and private space law Much attention is devoted to the law of air commerce: bilateral air services agreements; inter-airline co-operation; the effect of competition, antitrust and European Union law; deregulation, privatization and commercialization of air transport; ownership and control of airlines, and airline alliances; multilateralisation of air transport; and congestion and environmental controls. The last chapter of the book briefly deals with the legal aspects of commercial outer space application. Increasingly, air transport, both in fact and in law, is becoming an ordinary industry like any other and is being treated as such. Rapidly, commercial outer space activities are being privatized and commercialized.",Kluwer Law International B.V.
The Use of Airspace and Outer Space for All Mankind in the 21st Century,Chia-Jui Cheng,"The very nature of international air transportation and outer space activities means that they have an international perspective. This is more evident today than at any time in the past, due to the intensification of trans-boundary trade, the internationalization of the division of work and the acceleration of technological progress. The Asian Institute of Air and Space Law, the Graduate School of Law, Soochow University, Taipei, the International Institute of Air and Space Law, Leiden University, and the Institute of Air and Space Law, McGill University, have instituted international conferences in order to provide a world platform for eminent specialists and scholars. The Tokyo Conference, upon which this excellent collection of papers is based, was concerned with a wide range of legal and practical questions arising from regulatory developments in international air transportation and in the exploration, exploitation and use of outer space and celestial bodies. The main topics of deliberation were: megacarriers in the 21st century, the need to revise the Bermuda Capacity Formula and the Chicago Convention, liability and responsibility in international aviation, safety, security and environment, airline industry competition, legal and political aspects of space transportation and manned space flights, the protection of the space environment and dispute settlement in air and space law. They are discussed in this volume with unparalleled authority.",Martinus Nijhoff Publishers

Humans in Outer Space - Interdisciplinary Odysseys,"Luca Codignola-Bo,Kai-Uwe Schrogl","Humans and space When faced with the issue of space exploration, one generally has an idea of the ?elds of study and disciplines that are involved: technology, physics and chemistry, robotics, astronomy and planetary science, space biology and medicine, disciplines which are usually referred to as the ?sciences?. In recent discussions, the human element of space exploration has attracted more and more the interest of the space sciences. As a consequence, adjacent disciplines have gained in relevance in space exploration and space research, in times when human space ?ights are almost part of everyday life. These disciplines include psychology and sociology, but also history, philosophy, anthropology, cultural studies, political sciences and law. The cont- bution of knowledge in these ?elds plays an important role in achieving the next generation of space exploration, where humans will resume exploring the Moon and, eventually, Mars,and wherespacetourism isbeginningtobedeveloped. With regard to technology, one might soon be prepared for this. Much less is this the case with space exploration by humans, rather than by robots. Robotic explorations to other planets across the solar system have developed in the past 50 years, since the beginning of the ?space age? with the presence of humans in nearby space and the landing on the Moon. Space exploration is now not only focused on technological achievements,asitsdevelopmentalsohassocial,culturalandeconomicimpacts. This makes human space exploration a topic to address in a cross-disciplinary manner.",Springer Science & Business Media

Going further than regarding humans as better-than-robot tools for exploration, it investigates the human quest for odysseys beyond Earth's atmosphere and reflects on arising issues related to Europe's role among the States conducting human exploration. It provides perspectives related to governance, management of space exploration, space settlements, the role of astronauts in the future as well as related to the encounter of extraterrestrial life.",Springer Science & Business Media

Placing Outer Space,Lisa Messeri,"In Placing Outer Space Lisa Messeri traces how the place-making practices of planetary scientists transform the void of space into a cosmos filled with worlds that can be known and explored. Making planets into places is central to the daily practices and professional identities of the astronomers, geologists, and computer scientists Messeri studies. She takes readers to the Mars Desert Research Station and a NASA research center to discuss ways scientists experience and map Mars. At a Chilean observatory and in MIT's labs she describes how they discover exoplanets and envision what it would be like to inhabit them. Today’s planetary science reveals the universe as densely inhabited by evocative worlds, which in turn tells us more about Earth, ourselves, and our place in the universe.",Duke University Press
