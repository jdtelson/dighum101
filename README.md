## Abstract of Group Project

This paper analyzes three articles in order to expose the inherent bias in the digital humanities. The majority of digital humanists are white men, creating skewed information. Minority groups and women have yet to establish themselves in the field, silencing their unique and untold stories, depriving the public of the true depth and spectrum of the humanities. The articles by Moya Z. Bailey, Lisa Marie Rhody, and Kim Gallon discuss how in the past, minority lenses have not been valued in the digital humanities, but it is now necessary to work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse field. More specifically, these authors call on those currently in the digital humanities for increased accessibility to the field in order to include groups which were formerly marginalized. By analyzing these writings in a group, we were able to employ the ideals that these authors call for: creating a collaboritve environment for the digital humanities that values varying persectives. We found that to accurately represent the world we live in, we must include and make space for new people to join the digital humanities, allowing for a more well rounded examination of the human condition.
